# Daedalus Landed

**Nonprofit-in-progress.**  
**Mission:** take the profit motive out of the basics of being human — starting with **mental health, creation, and education.**

We’re building free (or radically affordable) AI systems that *actually* help people and don’t treat them as ad inventory, data exhaust, or whales to be monetized.

This org is the home of two flagship systems:

- **NOUS** – *“Not Your Therapist”* and also a **next-gen personal assistant**  
- **ENODIOS** – an **everything agent** so creation isn’t paywalled

---

## Why Daedalus Landed exists

Right now, to get serious AI for your life or your work, you mostly have to:

- Pay for premium models every month  
- Hand over your data, your behavior, and your attention  
- Or settle for weak “free” tools that quietly exploit you

Daedalus Landed is trying a different path:

> **Build strong, humane AI systems under a nonprofit umbrella,  
> keep the core tools free or radically cheap,  
> and refuse to fund it by selling users out.**

We’re early. The code is messy, the dream is not.

## 🌒 NOUS – Not Your Therapist (But Actually Helpful)

**NOUS** is what happens when you admit the obvious:  
people are already using chatbots like friends, therapists, and life coaches.

So instead of pretending that’s not happening, NOUS asks:

> *“What if the system was actually designed to help,  
> with real skills and real limits?”*

### What NOUS is

- A **mental-health-aware AI companion** that:
  - Helps you practice real tools (CBT, DBT, etc.), not just “positive vibes”  
  - Tracks patterns over time and reflects them back in plain language  
  - Helps you build coping plans, routines, and emotional regulation skills  

- A **next-gen personal assistant** that:
  - Knows your calendar, tasks, and habits  
  - Helps plan days, weeks, and long-term goals in a *holistic* way  
  - Integrates with your tools (music, notes, etc.) to manage your actual life, not just your inbox  

- A **safety-aware system** that:
  - Has *hard edges* around what it will and won’t do  
  - Knows when to say “this is beyond me — here’s how to find a human professional”  
  - Is being designed to be **less environmentally wasteful** than the current mega-model insanity

### What NOUS is **not**

- ❌ Not a licensed clinician  
- ❌ Not a crisis service  
- ❌ Not a replacement for real therapy, psychiatry, or emergency care

> NOUS is “Not Your Therapist” on purpose.  
> It’s a **skills engine + life OS**, not a fake doctor.

## 🛠 ENODIOS – The Everything Agent for People Who Can’t Afford $20/Tool

AI is quickly becoming: *“paywall your way to power or get left behind.”*

**ENODIOS** is our rebuttal:

> **Take free / low-cost models, orchestrate them smartly, and squeeze every ounce of value out of them so normal people can build anything.**

### What ENODIOS does

- Acts as an **everything agent**:
  - Code generation + refactoring  
  - Content + copy + research  
  - Creative work (ideas, outlines, drafts, scripts)  
  - Glue logic between tools and services  

- Uses a **multi-model, open-first stack**:
  - Prioritizes free and open models  
  - Wraps them in orchestration so they perform like premium tools in many workflows  
  - Lets people actually *ship* things without burning cash every time they create

- Lives in an environment designed for:
  - **Making** things, not just chatting  
  - Reusability, templates, pipelines  
  - “I have an idea; let’s build it” energy, without a credit-card wall

## 🗺 Repo Map

Daedalus Landed is an organization with multiple repos.  
A likely layout (subject to change):

- `nous-core/` – Core NOUS engine, state + skills + safety rails  
- `nous-frontend/` – Interfaces, assistant UX, integrations  
- `enodios-core/` – Orchestration engine for multi-model “everything agent”  
- `enodios-vscode/` or `enodios-ui/` – IDE / UI integrations  
- `docs/` – Project docs, architecture, ethics, and research notes  
- `infra/` – Deployment, infra, monitoring, and environment configs

> 🔧 **This README is the “front door.”**  
> Check the individual repos for language, stack, and contribution details.

---

## 🔍 Status

- **NOUS:** early pre-beta, core behaviors and scaffolding under active construction  
- **ENODIOS:** pre-beta, originally a coding agent, now expanding into a general “make anything” agent  
- **Daedalus Landed (nonprofit):** in formation; legal structure and funding runway are being built publicly

You should assume:

- APIs will change  
- Architectures will move  
- Docs may lag the code slightly as we sprint

## 🤝 How to Support

We’re trying to keep these systems **free from ad-tech and predatory monetization**.  
That means we need help with the unsexy part: infra, hosting, audits, and eventually clinical research.

Ways to support:

- ⭐ **Star the repos** – visibility matters more than you think  
- 🐛 **Open issues** – bug reports, safety concerns, weird edge cases  
- 🧪 **Help test** – dogfood early builds and tell us what breaks  
- 💸 **Fund the work** (once links are live):
  - GitHub Sponsors: `github.com/sponsors/DaedalusLanded`
  - Crowdfunding: `[link-here]`

No donation buys you surveillance rights. No donation buys you a data firehose.  
It just keeps the lights on and the servers up.

## 🧭 Values & Ethics

We’re still writing the full ethics manifesto, but the core lines are:

- **People > product.** Users are humans, not “MAUs” to optimize.  
- **Open > opaque.** Code, decisions, and failures should be explainable.  
- **Non-extractive by default.** No dark patterns, no casino UX, no secret data resale.  
- **Safety first, not last.** Especially around mental health, crisis content, and vulnerable users.  
- **Environmentally conscious.** We will never be perfect, but model choice, caching, and infra design will factor in energy cost, not just latency.

We expect — and welcome — critique from:

- Mental health professionals  
- People with lived experience  
- AI safety, ethics, and disability advocates  
- Infra / security / privacy experts

---

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing

We’re looking for:

- **Engineers** – Python, TypeScript, orchestration, infra, security  
- **UX / product folks** – flows that don’t treat people like stats  
- **Clinicians / researchers** – to help design and evaluate NOUS responsibly  
- **Writers / educators** – to help build accessible skills content and docs

General flow:

1. Open an issue or join the discussion in the relevant repo  
2. Propose your idea / fix / concern  
3. Submit a PR once aligned on direction

We’re early. Things are chaotic. If you like building in the weird, this is the window.

---

## ⚠️ Mental Health Disclaimer

NOUS and any related tools:

- Do **not** replace professional mental health care  
- Do **not** provide crisis intervention  
- Should **never** be your only support in a life-threatening situation  

If you are in immediate danger or crisis, **do not** rely on these systems.  
Contact your local emergency number or a trusted crisis hotline in your region.

## 📜 License

License for each repo may differ (e.g., MIT / Apache-2.0 / AGPL).  
Check the `LICENSE` file in each project for specifics.
